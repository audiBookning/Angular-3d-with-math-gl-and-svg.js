# TODOs

## Desired API (work in progress)

### SVG

- Animate

  - requestFrame

  - popmotion

- transform

- render

### OBJ3D

- transform

  - obj -nodes

    - translate

    - rotation

  - obj - polygon

    - translate

    - rotation

  - camera

    - center
    - eye
    - up

  - projection

    - perspective

    - orthogonal

## simple Stories

- orbit the obj in the center of the screen

  - rotate obj around its center or rotate camera around the obj

  - center on SVG or camera

- stretch an obj (cube is the simplest in this case) along an axis

  - with a fixed obj,

    - translate a face (polygon) by its normal

    - deform the whole obj along an axis centered on its center
